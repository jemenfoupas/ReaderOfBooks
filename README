## Overview

This project is a  graphical user interface for the previous project witch was 
an application that organize a collection of books. this program takes a csv file that contains
text files and creates buttons for each text file and displays the files information when 
the button is press

## Reflection

this activity was interesting, it made me use my previous project and add on to it. it was
difficult at first because I did not understand how to read the map of the classes, it took 
me some time to get it but I did and things got a lot faster.

some other thing that I had to deal with was that it was not easy to learn the other things 
that I was not taught how to use in class. like how to set a border on the JPanels. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile all that the user needs to do is press the run button on the top bar 
if they are running the code on eclipse. after that the user can needs to enter a csv
file that contains other file names, ones that is done they can press the load button and then 
they can select any of the book buttons to see the books title , author and text.

If the user goes trough the console they can compile and run the application
by running the command:
javac ReaderOfBooks.java
java ReaderOfBooks

ones that is done the user can needs to enter a csv file that contains other 
file names, ones that is done they can press the load button and then 
they can select any of the book buttons to see the books title , author and text.

## Sources used

I only used my previous activities, projects, google slides and 
the tutors to get the project done.
